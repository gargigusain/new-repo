# Employee Management Portal - Project Plan

## Overview
The **Employee Management Portal** is a web application that allows businesses to manage employee data, attendance, and leave requests. The portal will have a backend built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, a MySQL database for data storage, and a frontend interface for users to interact with the system.

   - Set up the backend and database  
   - Create basic routes and implement database connection  
   - Build database schema and necessary tables  
   - Begin frontend development for basic structure  
   
2. **Core Features Development (Jan 25 - Feb 7, 2025)**  
   - Implement employee management features (add, edit, delete employees)  
   - Build attendance tracking and leave request functionalities  
   - Develop authentication and role-based access control (Admin, HR, Employee)  
   
3. **User Interface & Final Integration (Feb 8 - Feb 14, 2025)**  
   - Enhance the user interface and improve UX  
   - Test and integrate frontend and backend  
   - Implement frontend forms for managing employee data, attendance, and leaves  
   
4. **Testing, Deployment, and Documentation (Feb 15 - Feb 28, 2025)**  
   - Conduct unit and integration tests  
   - Deploy the backend on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku)  
   - Finalize documentation (API documentation, user manual)  
   - Complete any remaining tasks and bug fixes

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**:  
  - Node.js  
  - Express.js  
  - MySQL  
  - Nodemon (for auto-reloading during development)  

- **Frontend**:  
  - HTML  
  - CSS  
  - JavaScript (possibly React for dynamic UI)  

- **Database**:  
  - MySQL  

- **Tools**:  
  - Visual Studio Code (IDE)  
  - MySQL Workbench (for database management)  
  - Postman (for API testing)  

## Database Schema
The database schema includes the following tables:
1. **Employees Table**: Stores employee information (name, email, role, department, etc.)
2. **Attendance Table**: Tracks employee attendance (present or absent) on specific dates.
3. **Leaves Table**: Manages leave requests, with statuses like Pending, Approved, or Rejected.

## Features
### 1. **Employee Management**:
   - Add, edit, and delete employee records  
   - Store employee details such as name, role, department, and email  
   - Admin and HR roles can manage employee records  

### 2. **Attendance Tracking**:
   - Track employee attendance on a daily basis  
   - Record whether an employee is present or absent  
   - Admin/HR can view and modify attendance records  

### 3. **Leave Management**:
   - Employees can request leave  
   - Admin/HR can approve or reject leave requests  
   - Track leave start and end dates along with leave status  

### 4. **Authentication & Role-based Access Control**:
   - Role-based login for Admin, HR, and Employees  
   - Different levels of access based on roles  
   - Admin can manage all data, HR can manage employees and attendance, and employees can view their data  

## Development Process

### Backend Development:
1. **Set Up the Express Server**  
   - Install dependencies: Express, MySQL, dotenv, and nodemon  
   - Configure the database connection (`db.config.js`)  
   - Set up API routes for employee management, attendance tracking, and leave requests  
   
2. **Database Integration**  
   - Define models for each table (employees, attendance, leaves)  
   - Set up MySQL queries to interact with the database  
   - Implement CRUD operations for employees, attendance, and leaves  

3. **Authentication and Authorization**  
   - Implement user authentication (sign-up/login) using JWT (JSON Web Token)  
   - Role-based access control for different user types (Admin, HR, Employee)  

4. **Testing the API**  
   - Use Postman to test API endpoints  
   - Ensure correct functionality of CRUD operations and role-based access  

### Frontend Development:
1. **User Interface Design**  
   - Design a simple and clean interface for managing employees, attendance, and leaves  
   - Implement forms for adding and editing employees, attendance, and leave requests  
   
2. **Integrating Frontend with Backend**  
   - Fetch data from the backend using AJAX or Fetch API  
   - Display employee data, attendance status, and leave information on the frontend  
   
3. **UI/UX Enhancements**  
   - Improve user experience with better navigation, error handling, and responsiveness  
   - Ensure the interface is user-friendly for Admin, HR, and Employee roles  

## Testing & Deployment
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual functions and API routes.  
- **Integration Testing**: Test the entire system to ensure frontend and backend communicate effectively.  
- **Deployment**:  
   - Host the backend on platforms like Heroku or DigitalOcean  
   - Deploy the frontend on platforms like Netlify or GitHub Pages  
   
## Documentation
- **API Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation for all API endpoints (requests, responses, and examples).  
- **User Manual**: Write a simple guide on how to use the portal, especially for HR and Admin roles.  

## Risks & Challenges
- **Role-based Access Control**: Ensuring secure and proper access for each role can be tricky and needs careful implementation.  
- **UI/UX Design**: Creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface might take additional time.  
- **Data Integrity**: Managing employee records and sensitive data securely is critical.  

## Conclusion
This project will help you build a fully functional Employee Management Portal with a clean architecture, secure user authentication, and easy-to-use interfaces. By following the project plan, you’ll be able to achieve all core features while learning key technologies.
